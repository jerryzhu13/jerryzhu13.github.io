In the Creativity and Research Computing (CARC) Lab, we study and create AI and machine learning methods for engineering design, with the goal of solving the most challenging design problems including high-dimensional problems, and novel design discovery. We work together to build a future where AI augments humans in design tasks in terms of **efficiency**, **creativity**, **complex reasoning**, and **trustworthiness**.

Through our research, we aim to develop general design tools that can be broadly applied to solving complex design problems in many science and engineering domains, such as aerodynamic design, functional materials design, soft robot design, and design for manufacturing.

For more information, you can explore our [**paper collection**](/papers/) or check out our [**open-source code**](https://www.github.com/jihao2021).

<!-- **<center>Join Us!</center>**

We have openings for **fully-funded Ph.D. positions** starting Fall 2024. If you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. and are passionate about AI and machine learning for engineering design, please don't hesitate to email Dr. Wei Chen at [w.chen@tamu.edu](mailto:w.chen@tamu.edu). Please include your CV, transcript, and a short description (â‰¤ 200 words) of your research interest as well as how your interest matches the DIGIT Lab. Please put "DIGIT Research Assistant Position" in the subject line. -->
